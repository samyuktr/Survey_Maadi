# Survey_Maadi
This is a mobile enterprise application that aims at providing a flexible approach to assist the exhaustive data collection process by the non-government organizations, to evaluate the health conditions, securely maintain process and make the data available when required. The implementation followed a client-server architecture. The client side had a responsive web page that could be deployed in a variety of mobile devices and the server side maintained and efficient MySQL database that handled concurrent transactions. HTML5, CSS, and Java Script was used for uploading the surveyed data and selective display for retrieved data from the server. PHP was used for server-side scripting.
